  "about": {
    "text1": "In 1991, we opened a bistro in a building that used to serve as a stable. Later, we expanded our offerings with pizzas and hamburgers. We upgraded the premises with a large terrace and garden, and in 2019, we extended and completely renovated the pizzeria. The interior and exterior of the pizzeria reflect our love for antiques, which give the spaces a homely touch. In this way, we strive to preserve the cultural heritage of our country. The unique feature of our pizzeria is the hayrack next to the main building, which we have adapted for parties and private gatherings.",
    "text2": "The hayrack, locally called 'kazuc,' with its wooden and open structure, is an unmistakable part of the Slovenian rural landscape. In Dolenjska, the so-called double hayrack or toplar is predominant. The hayrack was originally intended for drying and storing crops, but today it is primarily used for storing agricultural machinery and tools. In the past, hayracks also had a social function, which we still preserve at Pizzeria Toplar. The Toplar hayrack was renovated for parties and private gatherings, using old materials from a barn and granary.",
    "text3": "Zagraška dolin'ca\n You are beautiful indeed.\n You have sunny ridges\n and small villages.\n\n The green Krka\n flows silently.\n Along its deep course\n it rushes into the distance.\n\n There stands a white church\n by the Krka River.\n Adorning the friendly\n Zagradec Valley.\n\n Lojze Zupančič",
    "text4": "A stone's throw away from the village of Zagradec lies our Park Loka by the Krka River. During hot summer days, it offers opportunities to cool off in the pleasantly chilly river on its waterfalls and in the shade of the diverse trees surrounding the park. We have enriched the park with numerous planted flowers and shrubs, and on the slope above the river, we created an impression of landscape diversity with arches and rockeries."
